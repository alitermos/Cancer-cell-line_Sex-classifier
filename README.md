# Using XIST, X-linked, and Y-linked genes to predict sex phenotype and complements for cancer cell lines
In this study, we analyzed a large data set of cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ([CCLE](https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/)), and constructed a “cell line sex classifier prototype” that predicts the phenotype and a possible sex compliment for a given cell line in the data. This paper addressed several key questions: What candidate genes have been selected for classification, and why? What criteria did the model used for classification? What was the overall accuracy of the model? And what were the false discovery rates for male and female predictions made by the model?
