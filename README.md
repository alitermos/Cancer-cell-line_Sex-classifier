# read-count-based_sex-classifier
A “cell line sex classifier prototype” that can predict, using sequencing read counts (expression levels based on a set of studied genes), the phenotype and a possible sex compliment for a given cancer cell line. This repo hosts pre-processing, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, as well as model construction, testing, and results.
